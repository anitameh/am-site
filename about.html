        <h3>Hey there.</h3>
        Anita does data science and strategy at BlackRock's AI Labs in New York City. Prior to this, Anita was in and out of graduate school (Harvard Computational Science and Engineering, M.B.A.) and was a data scientist at BuzzFeed and Accenture's R\&D Lab, where she focused on graph theory, machine learning tools, and data-driven journalism. Anita is most passionate about using computational science and artificial intelligence technologies to solve societal problems, and has a special spot in her heart for Bayesian methods and US K-12 education. Her hybrid skill set and "full stack" approach to data science has evolved in parallel with the field of data science. It's fueled opinions and a unique frontline experience that she writes about regularly.
        <br><br>
        Originally a California girl, Anita now lives in New York City.
